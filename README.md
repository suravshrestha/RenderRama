# RenderRama

**RenderRama** is an interactive visualizer designed for exploring 2D and 3D transformations, as well as Bezier curve modeling.

Built with React.js (TypeScript) and powered by [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js), RenderRama offers an intuitive and dynamic way to understand and experiment with computer graphics concepts.

## Features

- 2D Transformations
  - Translation (x and y direction)
  - Rotation (clockwise and anti-clockwise about origin)
  - Scaling (both directions)
  - Reflection (about x, y, y=x, and y=-x axes)
  - Shearing (x, y, and both directions)
- 3D Transformations
  - Translation (x, y, and z direction)
  - Rotation (about x, y, and z axes)
  - Scaling (x, y, and both directions)
  - Shearing (x and y direction)
- Curve Modeling
  - Cubic Bezier curve
